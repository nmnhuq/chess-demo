3. White pieces (you) always move first
4. Click on any of your pieces to see where it can move

### Basic Rules

#### How Pieces Move
- **Pawn (â™™)** - Moves forward one square, captures diagonally
- **Knight (â™˜)** - Moves in an L-shape, can jump over pieces
- **Bishop (â™—)** - Moves diagonally any distance
- **Rook (â™–)** - Moves horizontally or vertically any distance
- **Queen (â™•)** - Combines rook and bishop movement
- **King (â™”)** - Moves one square in any direction

#### Objective
The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king - putting it under attack with no way to escape.

### Special Moves

#### Castling
Move your king two squares toward a rook, and the rook jumps over the king. You can only castle if:
- Neither piece has moved
- No pieces are between them
- The king is not in check
- The king doesn't move through check

#### En Passant
A special pawn capture that can occur when an enemy pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position, landing beside your pawn.

#### Pawn Promotion
When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, it can become any piece (usually a queen).

## Tips for Beginners

### Opening Principles
1. **Control the center** - Place pawns on e4, d4, e5, or d5
2. **Develop pieces** - Bring out knights and bishops
3. **Castle early** - Get your king to safety
4. **Don't move the same piece twice** - Develop all pieces first
5. **Don't bring your queen out too early** - It can be attacked

### Basic Tactics to Learn
- **Fork** - Attack two pieces at once
- **Pin** - Attack a piece that can't move without exposing a more valuable piece
- **Skewer** - Force a valuable piece to move and capture the piece behind it

### Piece Values (for trades)
- Pawn = 1 point
- Knight = 3 points
- Bishop = 3 points
- Rook = 5 points
- Queen = 9 points
- King = Priceless (losing it means losing the game)
